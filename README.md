# VPC Creation with Terraform & GitHub Actions

This GitHub repository is a comprehensive guide and automation project for creating Virtual Private Clouds (VPCs) using Terraform and harnessing the power of GitHub Actions for infrastructure as code (IaC) deployment and management.

## Key Features

1. **Terraform Infrastructure as Code:** We provide Terraform scripts for defining and provisioning VPC resources. Manage your VPC configuration in a structured, version-controlled manner.

2. **GitHub Actions Workflow:** Automate the deployment and management of your VPC infrastructure with GitHub Actions. Easily trigger updates, rollbacks, and more directly from your repository.

3. **Modular and Scalable:** Our Terraform modules and configurations are designed to be modular, making it easy to extend and adapt the VPC to your specific needs.

4. **Security Best Practices:** Learn how to implement security best practices for your VPC, including network ACLs, security groups, and more.

5. **Documentation:** Detailed documentation is provided to guide you through the process, helping you understand the Terraform code and GitHub Actions workflows.

6. **Contributions Welcome:** We encourage contributions from the community to improve and expand the project. If you have suggestions or improvements, feel free to submit a pull request.
